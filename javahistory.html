        <h1> JAVA</h1>
        <pre>Java was created at Sun Microsystems, Inc., 
        where James Gosling led a team of researchers in 
        an effort to create a new language that would allow 
        consumer electronic devices to communicate with 
        each other.Work on the language began in 1991, 
        and before long the team's focus changed to a new 
        niche, the World Wide Web.
